# Changelog

## v3.4.9 — Code quality + CI lint pipeline (2026-03-05)

### Code quality
- **Zero Ruff findings** — removed 12 unused imports, 2 stale f-prefixes, 1 identity test
- **Zero Bandit high-severity** — added `usedforsecurity=False` to Shadowsocks MD5 (protocol-required, not security)
- **Zero mypy errors** — type annotations for all unchecked assignments, `ServiceState.STOPPED` added to enum,
  None-guard on MQTT publish, pydantic mypy plugin (`mypy.ini`) for Pydantic model validation
- **Zero ShellCheck findings** — quoted variable expansion in init-vpn.sh
- **Zero pip-audit CVEs** — all dependencies clean
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` default corrected to 15 in Dockerfile (was still 30)

### CI pipeline
- New **lint** job runs in parallel with tests — Ruff, Bandit (high), mypy, ShellCheck, pip-audit,
  Hadolint (Dockerfile), npm audit (frontend deps)
- New **scan** job — Trivy scans the built container image for OS-level CVEs (Alpine apk packages,
  system libraries) at CRITICAL and HIGH severity
- Build gates on both `lint` and `test`; smoke gates on `build` and `scan`
- Total pipeline: lint (8 tools) + test (734 tests) → build (3 arches) → scan (Trivy) → smoke

## v3.4.8 — Shadowsocks server + settings panel UX (2026-03-05)

### Shadowsocks proxy
The Shadowsocks AEAD crypto library (shipped in v2.5.0) is now wired into a real TCP proxy server.
Clients connect, exchange salts, and relay traffic through the VPN tunnel with full AEAD encryption.

- **ShadowsocksService** — standalone TCP server implementing the standard Shadowsocks protocol
  (salt exchange → AEAD-decrypt target address → connect → encrypted bidirectional relay)
- **AES-256-GCM** and **ChaCha20-Poly1305** ciphers
- Default port **8388**, configurable via `SHADOWSOCKS_PORT`
- Started/stopped in FastAPI lifespan alongside HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies
- Firewall rules added to killswitch (input + output from allowed networks)
- `shadowsocks_state` tracked in StateManager + snapshot
- Prometheus metric: `tunnelvision_shadowsocks_up`
- Full config chain: `SHADOWSOCKS_PORT` env → Config → settings YAML → UI

### Settings panel UX
- **Toggle switches** for all 17 boolean fields — no more typing "true"/"false"
- **Number inputs** for numeric fields (ports, intervals, thresholds)
- **Collapsible sections** with chevron — VPN section open by default, sections with
  unsaved changes auto-open, dirty indicator dot on collapsed headers
- Shadowsocks split into its own section (separate from SOCKS5)
- Groups reordered: VPN first, providers grouped, General last
- Env var names shown inline with labels (smaller, cleaner)

### Tests
- 734 passed (+25 new: address parsing, lifecycle, full connection flow, domain targets,
  error handling, config wiring, singleton)

## v3.4.7 — Rotate geographic diversity (2026-03-05)

### Bug fixes
- **Rotate no longer sticks to the same country** — when no country filter is set,
  `POST /vpn/rotate` now picks a random country (excluding the current one) before
  score-selecting within it. Previously, the globally highest-scoring country won
  every rotation (Switzerland in practice), making rotate feel broken even though
  it was technically working.
- **Filter-constrained rotation unchanged** — if `VPN_COUNTRY` or `VPN_CITY` is set,
  rotate still score-selects within that pool as before.

### Tests
- 716 passed (+7 rotate diversity tests)

---

## v3.4.6 — SSE reliability + full settings exposure (2026-03-05)

### Bug fixes
- **SSE-triggered refreshes no longer serve stale data** — the 5s GET cache in the
  frontend was returning cached responses when SSE events fired immediately after a
  user action (e.g. Disconnect fired SSE at T+0.1s, cache hit returned pre-disconnect
  state). Fixed by invalidating affected cache keys before bumping the refresh signal.
- **Watchdog events now trigger UI refresh** — `useSSE` only listened for `vpn_status`
  and `vpn_state`. All five watchdog events (`recovered`, `reconnecting`, `failover`,
  `degraded`, `cooldown`) were broadcast over SSE but silently dropped by the frontend.
  Added `SSE_REFRESH_EVENTS` list covering all event types.

### Features
- **Watchdog tuning exposed as live settings** — `HANDSHAKE_STALE_SECONDS`,
  `RECONNECT_THRESHOLD`, and `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` were previously hardcoded. Now
  configurable via env var, YAML file, or the Settings UI — and hot-reloadable
  without a container restart (watchdog reads them each tick via `_load_setting()`).
- **Settings panel is now a single pane of glass** — 9 previously env-only fields
  added to the UI: `vpn_enabled`, `vpn_type`, `wireguard_dns`, `qbt_enabled`,
  `webui_port`, `mqtt_topic_prefix`, `mqtt_discovery_prefix`, `allowed_networks`, `tz`.
  Each shows its `$ENV_VAR` name and the ⚡/🔄 indicator for hot-reload vs restart.
- **New Watchdog and qBittorrent groups** in the Settings panel.
- **Watchdog check interval tightened** — default `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` reduced from
  30s to 15s. Halves worst-case autonomous VPN drop detection latency.

### Tests
- 709 passed (unchanged)

---

## v3.4.5 — Internal code quality pass II (2026-03-05)

### Bug fixes
- **MQTT async regression fixed** — `do_qbt_pause`/`do_qbt_resume` were converted to
  `async def` in v3.4.4 but `_on_message()` (a paho sync callback thread) called them
  synchronously, receiving back a coroutine object instead of an `ActionResponse`. Fixed
  with `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` against the event loop captured at startup.

### Refactoring
- **qBittorrent status endpoint uses httpx** — three `subprocess.run(["curl"...])` calls
  replaced with a single shared `http_client()` async context; deferred `import json`
  removed (httpx exposes `.json()` natively).
- **Deferred imports moved to module level** — `from datetime import datetime` inside
  try-blocks in `system.py` and `metrics.py`; `import os` inside `run()` in `dns.py`.
- **`/system` Alpine version uses `Path.read_text()`** — replaced `subprocess.run(["cat",
  "/etc/alpine-release"])` with a direct file read.
- **`tar.extract()` now passes `filter="data"`** — suppresses Python 3.12 deprecation
  warning and prevents path traversal via symlinks in restored backup archives.
- **`asyncio.get_event_loop()` replaced** — `dns.py` and `natpmp.py` now use
  `asyncio.get_running_loop()` / `asyncio.ensure_future()` (deprecated API removed).
- **MQTT `sw_version` uses `__version__`** — was hardcoded as `"0.1.0"`.

### Tests
- 709 passed (unchanged)

---

## v3.4.4 — Internal code quality pass (2026-03-05)

### Refactoring
- **Eliminated duplicated WireGuard activation logic** — `bring_up_wireguard_file()` is now
  a single shared utility in `constants.py`. Previously the PostUp/PostDown strip + wg-quick
  sequence existed independently in both `connect.py` and `watchdog.py`, with subtle divergence
  in killswitch handling.
- **Eliminated duplicated config-file enumeration** — `list_config_files()` moved to
  `constants.py`; both `connect.py` and `watchdog.py` now share it.
- **Provider metadata no longer allocates on every access** — `VPNProvider.get_meta()` is a
  new classmethod that caches `ProviderMeta` per class. The previous pattern of
  `cls.__new__(cls)` + `cls.meta.fget(instance)` appeared in 5 places; all replaced.
- **Server cache refresh properly encapsulated** — `VPNProvider.refresh_cache()` is a new
  base-class method. The server-list updater no longer reaches into `_server_cache`/
  `_cache_time` from outside the class.
- **Sidecar mode detection unified** — watchdog was checking `gluetun_url != default`,
  status route was checking `vpn_provider == "gluetun"`. Both now use the same condition.
- **`_select_server()` scores precomputed once** — previously scored each server 2N+1 times
  (sort + top-score check + uniform check); now computed once and reused.
- **qBittorrent API calls no longer block the event loop** — `do_qbt_pause/resume` converted
  from blocking subprocess curl to async httpx. Same for the qBittorrent health check and
  geo-IP check in the setup wizard.
- **Setup wizard handles all WireGuard providers generically** — `setup_credentials()`
  previously hardcoded `("mullvad", "ivpn")` for WireGuard credential validation. Now
  checks `provider_meta.supports_wireguard` — NordVPN, Windscribe, Surfshark, AirVPN, etc.
  correctly save private key + address through the wizard.
- **PIA key exchange uses `self.WG_PORT`** — hardcoded `1337` in the URL replaced with
  the class constant.
- **`forwarded_port` setter accepts `None` to delete** — consistent with StateManager's
  property pattern; `delete_forwarded_port()` delegates to it.
- Deferred stdlib imports (`asyncio`, `shutil`, `subprocess`) moved to module level.

### Tests
- 709 passed (unchanged — test patches updated to follow `bring_up_wireguard_file`
  moving from watchdog to constants)

## v3.4.3 — Fix server selection bias + killswitch on rotate (2026-03-05)

### Bug fixes
- **Rotate now picks genuinely random servers** — when a provider returns no load data
  (Mullvad: `load=null` for all 567 servers), all scores were equal and Python's stable
  sort meant the "top 5" was always the first 5 alphabetically (Albania + Argentina every
  time). Fixed: uniform scores now pick from the full candidate pool. Pool size is also
  dynamic — 20% of candidates, min 5, max 25 — rather than a hard-coded 5.
- **Speed normalization cap raised to 20 Gbps** — providers with 10 and 20 Gbps tiers
  were both capping at 1.0 (10 Gbps was the old ceiling), making speed useless as a
  signal. 20 Gbps = max now differentiates the tiers.
- **Killswitch no longer blocks WireGuard handshake after rotate/reconnect** *(from v3.4.2)*
  — `_reconnect_vpn` now re-runs `init-killswitch.sh` after `wg-quick up` so nftables
  allows the new server's endpoint. Previously the old server's IP was locked in, silently
  dropping all handshake packets (interface up, 0 B received).

### Tests
- `test_uniform_scores_pick_from_full_pool` — verifies >5 distinct servers appear across
  200 rotations when all scores are equal

---

## v3.4.2 — Fix killswitch blocking rotate/reconnect (2026-03-05)

### Bug fix
- **Rotate/reconnect now works with killswitch enabled** — `_reconnect_vpn` wasn't re-running
  `init-killswitch.sh` after `wg-quick up`. The killswitch locks nftables to the previous
  server's endpoint IP, so WireGuard handshake packets to the new server were silently dropped
  (interface up, 0 B received). `init-killswitch.sh` now runs after every `wg-quick up`,
  updating the allowed endpoint to match the new server. `activate_config` already did this
  correctly; `_reconnect_vpn` now matches.

---

## v3.4.1 — Rotate fix + build hardening (2026-03-05)

### Bug fixes
- **Server rotation now works** — rotate/connect was writing the new WireGuard config to
  `/config/wireguard/wg0.conf` but `wg-quick` was reading the stale `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`
  copied once at startup. `_reconnect_vpn` now syncs the config before every `wg-quick up`.
- **arm/v7 builds fixed** — `lightningcss` (Tailwind v4's Rust CSS compiler) has no
  arm-musl binary. The UI builder stage is now pinned to `linux/amd64`; the output
  (static HTML/CSS/JS) is architecture-agnostic.

### Housekeeping
- `init-wireguard.sh` → `init-vpn.sh` — the script handles both WireGuard and OpenVPN;
  the old name was misleading. All s6 dependency tokens and Python references updated.
- `tests/test_s6_service_graph.py` — new pure-filesystem validator catches dangling s6
  service references after renames (exactly the class of bug this rename introduced).

### Tests
- 706 total (up from 698): 4 reconnect-sync tests, 4 s6 graph-validator tests

---

## v3.4.0 — Multi-Architecture: linux/arm/v7 (2026-03-04)

### Multi-architecture builds
TunnelVision now ships native images for `linux/arm/v7` in addition to `amd64` and `arm64`.
Raspberry Pi 2 and Pi 3 users (running 32-bit OS) can now pull a native image — no QEMU overhead.

- Build matrix extended to `linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7`
- s6-overlay ARCH mapping extended: `arm → armhf`, with stubs for `386 → i686` and `ppc64le → powerpc64le`
- `cryptography` removed from pip requirements; replaced by Alpine's `py3-cryptography` package (44.0.0, pre-compiled for all arches)
- `uvicorn[standard]` → `uvicorn` — drops `watchfiles` (no arm/v7 wheel; unused in production anyway)

---

## v3.3.0 — Provider Health Dashboard + CI Test Pipeline (2026-03-04)

### Provider Health Dashboard
New dashboard card exposing live observability for the active VPN provider.

- **API reachability** — HEAD-pings the provider's API endpoint with 3s timeout; shows green/red dot and round-trip latency
- **Server cache status** — number of servers in cache and age since last refresh; amber dot when stale (>1h)
- **Account expiry** — for Mullvad and AirVPN: expiry date, days remaining, and a color-coded progress bar (green >30d, amber 7–30d, red <7d)
- **Manual refresh** — Refresh button triggers a new check without waiting for the 5-minute poll interval
- New `GET /api/v1/vpn/provider-health` endpoint
- `HEALTH_PING_URL` class constant added to `VPNProvider` base; Mullvad, IVPN, PIA, and ProtonVPN configured

### CI test pipeline
Tests now run in GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.

- New `test` job: Python 3.12, installs requirements, runs `pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`
- `build` job depends on `test` — broken tests block Docker image pushes

### Tests
- 698 total tests (up from 691)

## v3.2.0 — Smart Server Selection + WireGuard Key Generation (2026-03-04)

### Smart server selection
Server rotation is no longer random. Servers are now scored by load and speed, and the connect
pipeline picks from the top tier — distributing traffic across the best options while reliably
avoiding bad ones.

- **Load-aware**: servers with lower load score higher (load=0/unknown treated as 50%)
- **Speed-aware**: `speed_gbps` contributes 30% of the score (providers that expose it: NordVPN, Mullvad)
- **Top-5 jitter**: picks randomly from the top 5 to avoid thundering-herd on a single "best" server
- **Rotation avoidance**: `POST /vpn/rotate` now excludes the current server, guaranteeing a server change
- **Worst servers excluded**: with 6+ servers in the pool, the bottom tier is never selected

### WireGuard key generation in setup wizard
Mullvad and IVPN users no longer need to leave the wizard to generate a keypair.

- New "Generate Key" button in the credentials step — generates a keypair server-side via `wg genkey`
- Private key is pre-filled in the private key field
- Public key is displayed in a copyable box with provider-specific registration instructions
- New `POST /setup/generate-keypair` backend endpoint

### Tests
- 691 total tests (up from 681)

## v3.1.0 — Full OpenVPN Parity (2026-03-04)

Setup wizard now fully supports OpenVPN-only providers. Previously, providers like HideMyAss,
VyprVPN, VPNSecure, CyberGhost, Perfect Privacy, and Giganews would drop users into a dead-end
credentials step. Now they get a proper config paste flow, optional credential fields, and a live
verify step — same first-class experience as WireGuard.

### Setup wizard
- OpenVPN-only providers now route to an OpenVPN config paste step instead of a credentials dead-end
- New `.ovpn` textarea with OpenVPN-appropriate placeholder and provider-specific instructions
- Optional username/password fields for providers that require credentials alongside the config
- Verify step now supports OpenVPN: starts the daemon, waits for `tun0`, runs geo-IP check, tears down cleanly

### Backend
- New `POST /setup/openvpn` endpoint — validates, writes `/config/openvpn/provider.ovpn`, optionally writes `credentials.txt`
- `POST /setup/verify` now auto-detects WireGuard vs. OpenVPN config and branches accordingly
- `POST /setup/complete` accepts OpenVPN config as valid; writes `vpn_type=openvpn` to settings when appropriate
- `GET /setup/status` now returns `has_config: true` when an OpenVPN config is present
- New constants: `OPENVPN_CONF_PATH`, `OPENVPN_CREDS_PATH` in `api/constants.py`

### Tests
- 681 total tests (up from 673)

## v2.7.0 — Infrastructure Hardening (2026-03-04)

Security, resilience, and observability upgrades across the boot chain, VPN engine, port forwarding, and server management layers.

### Firewall-First Boot
- Pre-VPN firewall phase (`init-firewall-pre`) runs before the WireGuard tunnel comes up, eliminating the startup leak window
- Parses the VPN endpoint from the active config (WireGuard or OpenVPN), resolves hostnames, and locks down all traffic to that endpoint + loopback + LAN API before any packets flow
- Setup mode (no config yet) skips gracefully — the lock applies only when a config is present
- Boot chain: `init-environment → init-firewall-pre → init-wireguard → init-killswitch`

### Userspace WireGuard Fallback
- `WG_USERSPACE=auto|kernel|userspace` — automatic detection of kernel WireGuard support at startup
- In `auto` mode (default): probes for the `wireguard` kernel module and falls back to `wireguard-go` if unavailable
- Works in LXC containers, NAS devices, and any environment without kernel module access
- `WG_USERSPACE=kernel` forces kernel mode and logs an error if unavailable; `WG_USERSPACE=userspace` forces wireguard-go unconditionally
- Implementation written to state file (`/var/run/tunnelvision/wg_implementation`) for observability

### Port Forward Hooks
- `PORT_FORWARD_HOOK` — path to a script or command called with the assigned port number on every port change
- Called with `0` when the port is released (tunnel teardown, rotation, stop)
- Fires from both the WireGuard port forward service (PIA) and the NAT-PMP service (ProtonVPN)
- Non-blocking, failure-tolerant: hook errors are logged but never propagate to the VPN lifecycle
- Enables external automation: update qBittorrent, update *arr configs, ping a webhook, anything

### Server List Auto-Updater
- Background service refreshes provider server caches on a configurable interval
- `SERVER_LIST_AUTO_UPDATE=true` (default) / `SERVER_LIST_UPDATE_INTERVAL=<seconds>` (default: `PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL`)
- Only refreshes providers with active instances — no wasted API calls for providers you're not using
- Starts and stops cleanly with the application lifecycle

### Richer Server Filters
- `ServerFilter` dataclass replaces loose `country/city` kwargs across the provider layer
- New filter dimensions: `owned_only`, `p2p`, `streaming`, `port_forward`, `secure_core`, `multihop`, `max_load`
- Filters compose with AND logic — combine any number of dimensions
- `GET /api/v1/vpn/servers` exposes all filter dimensions as query params
- `POST /api/v1/vpn/connect` accepts filter fields in the request body
- Response expanded: `city_code`, `load`, `port_forward`, `p2p`, `streaming`, `secure_core`, `multihop`

### Tests
- 65 new tests covering pre-VPN firewall script parsing, userspace WireGuard detection, port forward hook execution, server filter logic, auto-updater settings and lifecycle
- 319 total tests (up from 254)

## v2.6.0 — Provider Framework Refactor (2026-03-04)

The foundation for scaling from 6 to 23+ native providers. Zero new user-facing features — all internal architecture. Every provider is now a single file, auto-discovered, auto-configured, and auto-tested.

### Provider Metadata Protocol
- `ProviderMeta` dataclass — single source of truth for each provider's identity, capabilities, setup type, and credential schema
- `CredentialField` dataclass — declarative credential definitions (key, label, type, secret flag, env var mapping, hints)
- Setup wizard, settings UI, and config system all read from provider metadata — no hardcoded field lists

### Unified Connect Pipeline
- Four near-identical `_connect_{mullvad,ivpn,pia,proton}` functions (320 lines) replaced by one generic `_connect_provider()` (60 lines)
- Pipeline: list servers → filter → pick server → `resolve_connect()` → write wg0.conf → reconnect → `post_connect()`
- `PeerConfig` dataclass — everything needed to write wg0.conf, returned by each provider's `resolve_connect()`
- Providers override `resolve_connect()` for custom auth (PIA key exchange) and `post_connect()` for hooks (port forwarding)
- `connect.py` reduced from 568 to 308 lines

### Shared Server Infrastructure
- Typed `ServerInfo` fields (`ipv4`, `public_key`, `port`, `port_forward`, `streaming`, `p2p`, `multihop`, `secure_core`, `tier`, `load`, `extra`) replace dynamic attribute hacking
- Server caching moved to base class with configurable TTL — providers override `_fetch_servers()`, not `list_servers()`
- Server filtering (`_filter_servers()`) deduplicated from 4 provider copies into one base class method
- Default `get_server_info()` searches by ipv4 match — providers only override if they need custom logic

### Self-Registering Provider Discovery
- `pkgutil`-based auto-discovery replaces hardcoded `PROVIDERS` dict
- Drop a file in `api/services/providers/`, it's registered everywhere — setup wizard, config, settings, connect pipeline
- `get_all_provider_meta()` generates setup wizard JSON from live provider metadata

### Metadata-Driven Config System
- `Config.__getattr__` dynamically resolves provider credentials from env vars and secret files — new providers don't need Config dataclass edits
- `get_all_configurable_fields()` merges base settings with provider credential fields — new providers are automatically configurable via settings UI
- `SettingsUpdate` accepts dynamic provider fields via Pydantic `extra="allow"`
- Backwards compatible — existing env vars, YAML settings, and Docker secrets continue to work unchanged

### Tests
- 94 new parametrized provider tests covering metadata completeness, interface compliance, API metadata, ServerInfo/PeerConfig integrity
- Cross-provider assertions: every provider gets the same validation (meta.id matches name, credentials use correct field types, secret fields use password type, filter capabilities are valid)
- DRY guardrails: `get_all_configurable_fields()` superset check, dynamic Config credential resolution, SettingsUpdate extra field acceptance
- 254 total tests (up from 157)

### Adding a New Provider
After this release, adding a provider is a single-file operation:
1. Create `api/services/providers/<name>.py`
2. Implement `name`, `meta`, `check_connection()`, `_fetch_servers()`
3. Optionally override `resolve_connect()` / `post_connect()` for custom auth
4. Auto-discovered, auto-configured, auto-tested — no other files need editing

---

## v2.5.0 — DNS, Proxies, ProtonVPN & DRY Refactor (2026-03-04)

### Docker Secrets Support
- Every `secret: true` field gains `_SECRETFILE` env var support (e.g. `ADMIN_PASS_SECRETFILE=/run/secrets/admin_pass`)
- 4-layer precedence: YAML > secret file > env var > default
- Works with Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, or any file-based secret injection
- 7 existing secret fields upgraded: `ADMIN_PASS`, `API_KEY`, `GLUETUN_API_KEY`, `PIA_PASS`, `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY`, `MQTT_PASS`, `NOTIFY_GOTIFY_TOKEN`

### Firewall Granularity
- `FIREWALL_VPN_INPUT_PORTS` — comma-separated ports to accept on VPN interface (TCP+UDP)
- `FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS` — CIDRs that bypass VPN (routed via host gateway)
- `FIREWALL_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` — path to custom nftables rules file (loaded after base killswitch)
- Killswitch auto-opens ports for DNS, HTTP proxy, SOCKS proxy when those services are enabled

### Built-in DNS Service
- DNS-over-TLS (DoT) upstream resolution via dnspython
- Response caching with TTL awareness (LRU, configurable)
- Ad-blocking via StevenBlack/hosts blocklist
- Malware blocking via URLhaus blocklist
- Surveillance blocking via WindowsSpyBlocker blocklist
- Custom blocklist URL support
- Runs as s6 longrun service (survives API crashes)
- Hot-reloadable blocklist settings (toggle ad/malware/surveillance blocking without restart)
- Prometheus metrics: `tunnelvision_dns_queries_total`, `tunnelvision_dns_cache_hits_total`, `tunnelvision_dns_blocked_total`
- 8 new settings: `DNS_ENABLED`, `DNS_UPSTREAM`, `DNS_DOT_ENABLED`, `DNS_CACHE_ENABLED`, `DNS_BLOCK_ADS`, `DNS_BLOCK_MALWARE`, `DNS_BLOCK_SURVEILLANCE`, `DNS_CUSTOM_BLOCKLIST_URL`

### ProtonVPN Provider
- Native ProtonVPN integration with server list from `api.protonvpn.ch`
- Server filtering by country/city with port-forward capability flags
- NAT-PMP port forwarding (RFC 6886) — raw UDP, no library needed
- 45-second keep-alive with 60-second lifetime

## v2.4.0 — Setup Wizard & Dashboard Components (2026-03-04)

The wizard now knows what you're setting up. Pick your provider, enter the right credentials, pick a server — no more pasting configs for providers that have APIs.

### Setup Wizard — Provider-Specific Flows
- **Mullvad / IVPN**: Private key + address + optional DNS fields → server picker → verify
- **PIA**: Username + password + port forwarding toggle → validates credentials via PIA API → server picker → verify
- **Gluetun**: URL + optional API key → validates gluetun connection → straight to done (skips WG verify)
- **Custom / Proton**: Paste config textarea → verify (unchanged existing flow)
- Server picker step with country dropdown, search filter, server table (hostname, location, speed, owned badge)
- `POST /setup/credentials` — validates and persists provider-specific credentials to `/config/tunnelvision.yml`
- `POST /setup/server` — select a server by hostname, reuses existing connect logic to generate WireGuard config
- `complete_setup` now persists `vpn_provider` to settings YAML — survives container restarts

### Settings
- `wireguard_private_key` and `wireguard_addresses` added to configurable fields — editable from settings UI
- New "WireGuard" section in settings panel between VPN and Gluetun

### Dashboard Components
- Connection history card — event timeline with timestamps
- Server browser modal — country filter, search, connect-to-server
- Multi-config manager — switch VPN configs from dashboard

### Bug Fix
- `verify_connection` now always tears down WG tunnel, including when geo-IP lookup fails (previously left tunnel up on that path)

---

## v2.3.0 — Self-Healing VPN (2026-03-03)

If the tunnel drops at 3am, TunnelVision brings it back. No cron jobs, no external scripts.

### Auto-Reconnect Watchdog
- Background asyncio service with state machine: MONITORING → DEGRADED → RECONNECTING → FAILING_OVER → COOLDOWN
- WireGuard health: `wg show wg0 latest-handshakes` staleness (>180s = stale)
- OpenVPN health: `tun0` interface existence check
- Sidecar health: gluetun API read-only probe
- Escalation: 1-2 failures → degrade + broadcast. 3rd failure → reconnect. Reconnect fails → failover to next config. All configs exhausted → cooldown 5min, reset, retry
- SSE broadcasts on every state transition (`watchdog_degraded`, `watchdog_reconnecting`, `watchdog_failover`, `watchdog_recovered`, `watchdog_cooldown`)
- MQTT HA Discovery entities: `watchdog_state`, `active_config`
- Notification webhooks fire on reconnect attempts and recovery
- Runtime toggle: re-reads `auto_reconnect` from settings YAML each tick — togglable without restart

### Multi-Config Failover
- Scans `/config/wireguard/*.conf` + `/config/openvpn/*.ovpn` for available configs
- On reconnect failure, cycles to next untried config
- Strips PostUp/PostDown from configs before activation (safety)
- Re-applies killswitch after config switch (nftables rules hardcode endpoint IP)
- Resets tried-config list on recovery or after cooldown

### Settings Hot-Reload
- 7 fields now take effect immediately without restart: `auto_reconnect`, `health_check_interval`, `vpn_country`, `vpn_city`, `notify_webhook_url`, `notify_gotify_url`, `notify_gotify_token`
- Watchdog re-reads `health_check_interval` from settings YAML each tick
- Notifications re-read webhook URLs from settings YAML on each send
- Server rotation re-reads `vpn_country`/`vpn_city` from settings YAML
- All 25 configurable fields now persist correctly via settings API (8 were silently dropped before)
- `needs_restart` response flipped from blocklist to hot-reload whitelist

### Settings Panel UI
- Per-field dirty tracking with amber border on changed inputs
- Per-field hot-reload indicator: green zap (instant) vs amber refresh (needs restart)
- "Unsaved" badge in header when changes exist
- Confirm dialog on close/cancel when dirty
- Save button disabled when no changes
- Footer legend showing icon meanings

### Bug Fix
- `active_config` in StateManager now set correctly for custom config rotation (was only set for Mullvad/IVPN/PIA)

### Tests
- 40 unit tests covering state transitions, health probes, escalation, failover, cooldown, config activation, settings hot-reload, singleton pattern, model alignment

---

## v2.2.0 — Architecture Cleanup (2026-03-04)

Internal refactor. Zero new features, zero breaking changes. The plumbing got proper.

### StateManager
- New singleton service (`api/services/state.py`) owns all `/var/run/tunnelvision/*` file I/O
- Typed property accessors for every state key, `snapshot()` for bulk reads
- Eliminates 5 duplicated `_read_state()` helpers scattered across routes

### Config Consolidation
- `os.getenv()` now only appears in `config.py` (and the intentional `settings.py` YAML fallback)
- All provider classes accept `Config` in `__init__` instead of reading env directly
- Added missing config fields: `mullvad_account`, `wireguard_private_key`, `wireguard_addresses`, `wireguard_dns`, `allowed_networks`, notification settings

### MQTT Dispatch
- `_on_message` now calls `do_vpn_restart()`, `do_qbt_pause()` etc. directly
- Killed subprocess curl to localhost — MQTT and REST share the same code path
- Control route handlers extracted into standalone `do_*()` functions

### Verification
- Zero `_read_state()` helpers remain
- Zero `subprocess curl localhost` calls
- `os.getenv` confined to `config.py`
- 30 files touched, +368/-318 lines

## v2.1.0 — Real-Time Events (2026-03-03)

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- `GET /api/v1/events` — persistent SSE stream for real-time state push
- Broadcasts on VPN state changes, control actions, IP changes
- 30s keepalive to prevent connection drops
- Dashboard UI now uses SSE — instant updates instead of 10s polling
- HACS integration uses SSE — instant HA entity updates instead of 15s polling
- Polling remains as fallback for resilience

### HACS Integration v0.2.0
- VPN switch — toggle on/off maps to connect/disconnect
- Killswitch switch — toggle on/off maps to enable/disable
- Removed redundant buttons (disconnect, reconnect, killswitch enable/disable)
- IoT class upgraded from `local_polling` to `local_push`
- Entity count: 12 sensors + 4 binary sensors + 5 buttons + 2 switches = 23

---

## v2.0.0 — Sidecar Mode (2026-03-03)

TunnelVision can now front gluetun. Use gluetun for the tunnel, TunnelVision for the eyes.

### Gluetun Sidecar Mode
- Set `VPN_PROVIDER=gluetun` — TunnelVision reads VPN state from gluetun's control server API
- Inherits all 30+ providers that gluetun supports — no provider-specific code needed
- Reads public IP, VPN status, and forwarded port from gluetun
- Enriches with geo-IP for country/city (gluetun's API only returns the IP)
- Full observability stack works in sidecar mode: dashboard, HA integration, Homepage widget, Prometheus, notifications
- Example compose at `examples/docker-compose.sidecar.yml`

### Two Modes, One Product
- **Standalone** — all-in-one container with built-in VPN, killswitch, qBittorrent (existing behavior)
- **Sidecar** — pairs with gluetun, adds dashboard + API + integrations on top

### New Env Vars
- `GLUETUN_URL` — gluetun control server URL (default `http://gluetun:8000`)
- `GLUETUN_API_KEY` — gluetun API key (if auth enabled)

### Provider Count: 5
custom, mullvad, ivpn, pia, gluetun (sidecar)

---

## v1.2.0 — Full Stack (2026-03-03)

Everything from the roadmap, in one push.

### Reconnect Endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/vpn/reconnect` — manually trigger VPN reconnection
- `AUTO_RECONNECT` config flag (default on) — foundation for future watchdog
- Server rotation reconnects through provider-aware logic (Mullvad, PIA, IVPN pick new servers)

### Notification Webhooks
- Discord, Slack, Gotify, and generic webhook support
- Fires on VPN disconnect, reconnect, port forwarding changes
- Set `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` for Discord/Slack/generic, `NOTIFY_GOTIFY_URL` + `NOTIFY_GOTIFY_TOKEN` for Gotify

### Speed Test
- `POST /api/v1/vpn/speedtest` — downloads 10MB from Cloudflare CDN, measures tunnel throughput
- Returns download_mbps, bytes, duration

### Config Backup/Restore
- `GET /api/v1/backup` — downloads tar.gz of tunnelvision.yml, qBittorrent.conf, and VPN configs
- `POST /api/v1/restore` — uploads backup archive, restores config (restart required)

### Connection History
- `GET /api/v1/vpn/history` — tracks server rotations, disconnects, reconnects
- Persists to `/config/connection-history.json` (survives container restarts)

### Grafana Dashboard Template
- Pre-built JSON at `examples/grafana-dashboard.json`
- VPN status, killswitch, uptime, transfer rates, total bytes, health — all wired to Prometheus metrics

### One-Liner Install Script
- `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasondostal/tunnelvision/main/scripts/install.sh | bash`
- Creates directory, downloads docker-compose.yml, prompts for WireGuard config

### Settings Panel Updates
- PIA credentials (pia_user, pia_pass, port_forward_enabled)
- Auto-reconnect toggle
- Notification webhook configuration (Discord, Slack, Gotify)

---

## v1.1.0 — Provider Enrichment (2026-03-03)

Three deep provider integrations. Progressive enrichment — set your provider, features light up.

### IVPN Provider
- Public server list with WireGuard public keys (`api.ivpn.net/v5/servers.json`)
- Connection verification via `api.ivpn.net/v4/geo-lookup` (confirms IVPN exit IP)
- Auto-generate wg0.conf from server list — no manual config needed
- Server rotation by country/city
- Same pattern as Mullvad — set `VPN_PROVIDER=ivpn` + `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY` + `WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES`

### PIA (Private Internet Access) Provider
- Token-based auth with `PIA_USER` + `PIA_PASS` — no WireGuard private key needed
- Ephemeral key negotiation — generates fresh WireGuard keypair per connection
- Server list from `serverlist.piaservers.net` with port-forward capability flags
- **Port forwarding** — set `PORT_FORWARD_ENABLED=true`, TunnelVision gets a port assignment and keeps it alive (15-min refresh). Port visible in API (`forwarded_port` field) and state file.
- Prefers port-forward-capable servers when port forwarding is enabled

### Other
- `forwarded_port` field added to `/api/v1/vpn/status`
- Setup wizard updated with IVPN and PIA provider descriptions
- Provider count: custom + Mullvad + IVPN + PIA (4 total)

---
